    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Water 6 cups</li>
        <li>Pasta</li>
        <li>1 tbsp oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Cumin seeds</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Peas</li>
        <li>Carrot chopped</li>
        <li>Tomato Puree</li>
        <li>Kasoori Methi</li>
        <li>Coriander Powder</li>
        <li>Chilli Powder</li>
        <li>Cilantro chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring 6 cups water to a boil in a large pot. When the water begins to boil, add salt and pasta.</li>
        <li>Cook the pasta al dente on a medium flame. It should be soft yet cooked but not chewy. Refer the package for exact cook time as each brand has a different cook time.</li>
        <li>Once done drain the pasta to a colander. You can also save 3 to 4 tbsps pasta cooked water. You can use this towards the end to bring the pasta to consistency.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a pan. Add cumin. When it begins to sizzle, add garlic. Fry the garlic for a minute or 2.</li>
        <li>Add onions and fry until they turn golden.</li>
        <li>Add the chopped vegetable and fry for 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add mashed tomatoes along with salt. Fry until the tomatoes turn soft and mushy. You can also puree the tomatoes and use. Most times I do puree them as my boys are super fussy with the skin of tomatoes.</li>
        <li>When raw smell of tomatoes disappear, add kasuri methi, masala powder and red chili powder.</li>
        <li>Fry for one to 2 minutes till the raw flavor of chilli powder goes away. If using cream add it now.</li>
        <li>Add cooked pasta</li>
        <li>Toss well and add coriander leaves. If it is too dry you can add little oil or pasta cooked water. Mix well and check salt. Add more if needed.</li>
        <li>Indian style pasta aka masala pasta is ready to serve.</li>
    </ol>
