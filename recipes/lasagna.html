    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>14 lasagna noodles</li>

        <li>2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</li>

        <li>1 cup (140 grams) chopped onion</li>

        <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic, 3 to 4 cloves</li>

        <li>1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes, or more to taste</li>

        <li>2 medium zucchini, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>

        <li>2 medium yellow squash, cut into 1/2-inch pieces</li>

        <li>One (12-ounce) jar roasted red peppers, drained and cut into 1/2-inch pieces, 1 heaping cup</li>

        <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>

        <li>Generous handful fresh basil leaves, chopped</li>

        <li>One (15-ounce) container ricotta cheese or cottage cheese</li>

        <li>2 large eggs</li>

        <li>2 ounces (60 grams) parmesan cheese, grated, about 2/3 cup</li>

        <li>8 ounces (230 grams) low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded, about 2 cups</li>

        <li>Salt and fresh ground black pepper, to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, then cook lasagna noodles according to package directions. To prevent the noodles from sticking after they are drained, add two teaspoons of olive oil to the pasta water. Drain, then lay flat on a sheet of aluminum foil.</li>
        <li>Heat the oven to 350° Fahrenheit. Lightly oil a 13-inch by 9-inch baking dish or spray with non-stick cooking spray.</li>

        <li>Heat the olive oil in a wide skillet with sides over medium heat.</li>

        <li>Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until translucent, about 5 minutes.</li>

        <li>Add the garlic, red pepper flakes, zucchini, yellow squash, and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the veggies are softened but still have some crunch, another 5 to 8 minutes.</li>

        <li>Stir in the roasted red peppers and crushed tomatoes. Bring to a low simmer and cook until the liquid has thickened and reduced by half, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the basil and season to taste with additional salt and pepper.</li>

        <li>While the sauce cooks, stir the ricotta cheese, eggs, and a 1/2 teaspoon of salt in a medium bowl until blended.</li>

        <li>Toss the parmesan cheese with the mozzarella. Set aside.</li>

        <li>Spoon enough vegetable mixture into the baking dish to lightly cover the bottom (about 1 cup). Arrange four noodles lengthwise and side-by-side to cover the bottom. If the noodles are short on one end, you may need to cut an extra noodle and place it into the dish to cover where the other noodles have not.</li>

        <li>Spread half of the ricotta cheese mixture over the noodles, then sprinkle a third of the parmesan and mozzarella cheeses on top of the ricotta. Finally, scatter a third of the vegetable sauce on top.</li>

        <li>Add another layer of four noodles and spread the remaining ricotta cheese over them. Scatter half of the parmesan and mozzarella cheeses over the ricotta. Spread half of the remaining vegetable sauce on top.</li>

        <li>Finish with a third layer of noodles and the remaining vegetable sauce. Finally, finish with the remaining cheese sprinkled all over the top.</li>

        <li>Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil and bake for 20 minutes; uncover, then bake for 15 minutes until the cheese is crusty around the edges.</li>

        <li>To make the cheese golden brown on top, slide the pan under the broiler and set to high heat for 1 to 2 minutes. Let rest 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>
    </ol>
