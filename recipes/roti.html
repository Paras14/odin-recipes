    <h3>How to make Roti/Chapati</h3>
    <p>Learn all the tips and tricks to make soft roti at home. This everyday Indian flatbread was a staple growing up, one that I ate every single day.</p>
    <p>Roti is made of whole wheat flour and nothing else really and is eaten in India with dal and curries. Roti is an integral part of Indian cuisine, the north Indian cuisine especially.

        I was born and raised in north India and grew up eating it everyday of my life.
        
        Roti, dal and rice were always on the table in my house for literally every meal.
        
        It took me several years to learn to how to make a good roti. Trust me, it’s a skill which needs a lot of practice.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>200 g Atta</li>
        <li>150 g Boiling water</li>
        <li>4 g salt</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set some water to boil. We prefer using an electric kettle for this as it is quick and energy efficient compared to boiling it on a gas stove.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl add 200 grams of atta (Indian style whole wheat flour), 4 grams of salt (2% of flour weight).</li>
        <li>Next, add 150 grams of boiling hot water (75% of flour weight) to the flour.</li>
        <li>Since the water is very hot, stir the flour and water initially with a spoon.</li>
        <li>Ready a bowl of room temperature water next to your mixing bowl.</li>
        <li>When the atta is cool enough to touch start kneading with your hand. Knead the dough with your knuckles stretching it out and folding it onto itself. This is a soft dough. To incorporate more water, intermittently dip your hand in the bowl of room temperature water and knead again. Knead until the dough is smooth and crack free—about 3–5 minutes if you knead without a break. Set a timer instead of guessing. We find that helpful.</li>
        <li>Cover with a fitting bowl and rest for ten minutes.</li>
        <li>After the rest, divide the dough into balls about 35 grams each. (we have reduced this from what is shown in the video because the weight of water has reduced)</li>
        <li>Roll between the palms of your hands into smooth disks. The rounder and smoother they are now, the easier it will be roll into round rootis later. Keep them covered to prevent drying.</li>
        <li>Time to roll. Keep a bowl full of flour (atta or maida) ready near your rolling surface for dusting from time to time.</li>
        <li>Dip a ball of dough into the flour, place it on the rolling surface, and press to flatten it. Roll with short strokes and keep rotating the disk—this is the key to a round rooti. Practiced rooti makers can simultaneously roll and rotate the dough with the movement of their wrist. Beginners, however, have to stop and rotate manually. From time to time sprinkle a little extra flour to avoid pinching or sticking of the dough. The disk should slide easily on the rolling surface. Roll along one side, not the centre. Once the rooti is about 16–18 centimetres in diameter, dust off the excess flour and set it aside.</li>
        <li>While you are rolling the rooti, set a heavy iron tawa or skillet to heat on the stove. A thick tawa retains more heat and cooks the outer surface of the rooti quickly. So that the insides can remain soft and puff up. If you have an infrared thermometer, the surface of the tawa should be about 250ºC.</li>
        <li>Once the tawa is very hot place the rooti on it. Wait until the wet spot recedes to the centre. This should take about 40 seconds. When you see small bubbles appear turn it over. Cook the other side for 5 seconds. Turn on another burner and place the rooti on full flame. If everything goes right, it will puff up completely. Once it puffs up turn it over and let the other side develop a few spots—should only take a few seconds.</li>
        <li>Maintaining the heat levels is key here. If the pan is not hot enough, the rooti will become crisp like a papad. If it is too hot it will develop burnt spots in some place but will remain wet in others and will stick to the pan. Once in a while, a rooti will just not puff up even though you seem to be doing everything right. Don't sweat it—the rooti will still be soft. Just keep trying to get better.</li>
